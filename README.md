# CryptoCurrency_Monte_Carlo_Simulation
This group will focus on identifying the risk of one or more crypto-currencies. Our data will be pulled from Yahoo Finance API and we will be pulling the end of day values of crypto-currencies and analyzing their historical log returns.  We want to estimate the volatility of cryptos by using a GARCH model. From the estimated volatilities, we can create a distribution which could then be used in a monte carlo simulation to generate a new return. We would then calculate the VaR of the simulations and draw our conclusions to the level of risk the cryptos have
